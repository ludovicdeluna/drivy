# Level 3

The car owner now wants his money.
We decide to take a 30% commission on the rental price to cover our costs and have a solid business model.

The commission is split like this:
- half goes to the insurance
- 1€/day goes to the roadside assistance
- the rest goes to us

Compute the amount that belongs to the insurance, to the assistance and to us.


# FOOTNOTE

As a developper, I've noticed a little mistake on the challange above. Be aware
result test show that the roadside assistance is 100€/day and not 1€/day. I keep
the initial challenge statement unchanged, but add this footnote for me.

# How to test

This is my answer to the challenge above. To validate this challenge, install
ruby 2.3 or higher and run from this folder :
- `ruby ./drivy_test.rb` to run tests
- `./main.rb` to run the challange
