# Level 5

We want to know how much money must be debited/credited for each actor (driver/owner/insurance/assistance/drivy).

Reminder:
- the driver must pay the rental price and the (optional) deductible reduction
- the owner receives the rental price minus the commission
- the insurance receives its part of the commission
- the assistance receives its part of the commission
- drivy receives its part of the commission, plus the deductible reduction

# How to test

This is my answer to the challenge above. To validate this challenge, install
ruby 2.3 or higher and run from this folder :
- `ruby ./drivy_test.rb` to run tests
- `./main.rb` to run the challenge
